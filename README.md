## üîß Method Summaries

1. **External GPS Spoofing Devices - developer simulation function without computer (Hardware)**

    **Description:** Developer simulation function without computer.

    **Pros:** System-wide spoofing, highly stable.
    **Cons:** Requires purchase of dedicated hardware.

    **Learn More:** [docs/hardware-devices.md](docs/hardware-devices.md)

2. **Bluetooth GPS Receivers Box & Dongles(Hardware)-External GPS singal reciever simulater**

    **Description:** Plug-and-play hardware that emulates GPS signals via Lightning or Bluetooth. Overrides the iPhone‚Äôs native GPS input.

    **Pros:** Portable, app-independent.
    **Cons:** Hardware cost.

    **Learn More:** [docs/bluetooth-dongles.md](docs/bluetooth-dongles.md)

3. **Xcode & macOS Developer Simulation - developer simulation function with computer**

    **Description:** Official Apple developer feature using Xcode‚Äôs Simulate Location on a connected device.

    **Pros:** Free, precise GPX support.
    **Cons:** Requires Mac, manual to set up, only for testing apps.

    **Learn More:** [docs/xcode-simulation.md](docs/xcode-simulation.md)

4. **Third-Party Desktop Applications - developer simulation function with computer**

    **Description:** GUI tools for Windows/Mac that spoof iPhone location over USB.

    **Examples:** iTools Virtual Location, Dr.Fone Virtual Location.

    **Pros:** User-friendly, some free trials.
    **Cons:** Paid license,Requires Mac or PC,potential security flags.

    **Learn More:** [docs/desktop-tools.md](docs/desktop-tools.md)

5. **App Store Location Spoofing Apps**

    **Description:** iOS apps that fake location within app sandbox (limited scope).

    **Examples:** Fake GPS Location Apps (may require special provisioning).

    **Pros:** No desktop needed.
    **Cons:** Limited to within-app,can not affact the iPhone GPS locaiton. App Store may remove them.

    **Learn More:** [docs/app-store-apps.md](docs/app-store-apps.md)

6. **VPN & Proxy**

    **Description:** Certain VPN or proxy services modify the IP address data.

    **Pros:** IP privacy.
    **Cons:** Only IP address can be modified. The GPS data can not be changed. Variable reliability, subscription costs.

    **Learn More:** [docs/vpn-proxy.md](docs/vpn-proxy.md)

7. **`simctl` Command-Line Simulation (Xcode CLI)**

    **Description:** Use `xcrun simctl` commands to simulate location on simulator or device.

    **Pros:** Scriptable, integrates into CI/CD.
    **Cons:** Requires Xcode CLI, less GUI.

    **Learn More:** [docs/simctl-cli.md](docs/simctl-cli.md)
